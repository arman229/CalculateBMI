# HealthTracker(BMI) Project


![bmioutputimage.jpg](src%2Foutputimage%2Fbmioutputimage.jpg)
This repository contains the source code and deployment details for the BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator project. The BMI calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their weight and height inputs. This can be useful for individuals who want to monitor their health and fitness levels.
 
## Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the BMI Calculator project through the following Netlify link:
[https://bmicalculator-arman.netlify.app/](https://bmicalculator-arman.netlify.app/).
## Features
- Easy-to-use interface for entering weight and height.
- Calculates BMI and provides an indication of the user's weight category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
- Responsive design for optimal usage on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
    https://github.com/arman229/CalculateBMI.git
    
2. Install node modules:
### `npm install`

3. Run this project in browser
### `npm start`

4. Runs the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
